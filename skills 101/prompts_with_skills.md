I'm attaching my weekly marketing campaign data. Analyze the data to help me understand how each channel is doing (funnel and efficiency performance) and if I need to reallocate my budget. I can shift up to $10k between channels, and limit increases to 15% per channel.

Present the results directly in the chat.
